        <h1>The 13 stages of an all-nighter</h1>
        <p>It's now or never: when nocturnal gets serious</p>
        <img src="images/deadline-closing.jpg">
        <p>It’s the night before your deadline. The blank solution on the Visual Studio is flashing on the screen for hours now; the flat’s empty, everyone’s out getting spannered and you’re on your own, in your ironic fetus posture, cying and cursing. The time is nigh for an all-nighter: you're preparing to do what you do four times a week anyway, just with fewer questionable remixes and lots of tequila.</p>
        <p>You were given the deadline weeks ago but somehow, in the dark wilderness of communal living and rat infestation, the wordcount slipped your mind. It’s time to crack out the Energy drink, honk up Insomnia by Faithless and do your time. But first! It's time to get that old coffee mashine to work and make you the essential bevrage of evey self-respected person.</p>

        <p>You’re feeling pretty confident. You’ve got hours! You’re doing great already. Sure, you waited until the last minute, but that’s because you OWN it. You didn’t need four weeks anyway.</p>
        <h1>2300</h1>

        <p>Hey, you remember why you took this subject! This is great! You’re up all night to get KNOWLEDGE. The pages are flying; your fingers haven’t had this much of a workout since the last time you played the X-box. which infact wasn't that long ago.</p>

        <p>Ok. Things are progressing. Better have another coffee. Boil kettle and settle back down with a calming ProPlus.</p>

        <p>Ok enough of that.</p>

        <p>You’re 800 words in. You’re the most badass thing that ever walked the planet. You could do this every night and not feel tired. Why do people complain after a night's hard graft? You were born to do this.</p>
        <h1>0300</h1>

        <p>Your eyes just did that heavy thing you specifically requested them not to do tonight. A cold shower will fix this. There’s been no hot water since your landlord said he’d fix it three months ago and for once, you’re grateful.</p>
        <h1>0400</h1>

        <p>Wait… are the neighbours going for it? Why is Mrs Next Door's light on? Why does that streetlamp keep flickering? Your wallpaper's peeling; you'd better smarten it up a bit. The cat wandering around that tree outside looks interesting, huh? What's that mould growing in the fridge? It's down to you to uncover these truths.</p>
        <h1>0500</h1>
        <img src="http://media3.giphy.com/media/jnO5ng7jXmjm0/200.gif">
        <p>Aaaaand your flatmates have returned. Two of them are snogging each other and the third's come home home without shoes. You make them all some toast, cos you're nice like that. One of them reads back what you’ve written in a slur and you realise you’ve typed at least three paragraphs of song lyrics you had on for background noise.</p>
        <h1>0600</h1>
        <img src="http://media1.giphy.com/media/iTnVKXAWDvRmw/200.gif">
        <p>Still only 900 words done. How has this happened? Your brain feels empty. Time is critical and you are on the edge.</p>
        <h1>0700</h1>
        <img src="http://media3.giphy.com/media/WA9ptg9ImMR2g/200.gif">
        <p>This is weird. You've got a surge as sunlight snakes through the greasy window pane. You're flying, baby, ride this kite!</p>
        <h1>0800</h1>
        <img src="http://media0.giphy.com/media/DA0JaEDWJVysE/200.gif">
        <p>You flew too high. You crashed. You got nothin'.</p>
        <h1>0900</h1>
        <img src="http://media0.giphy.com/media/hRDd1hmHhwl8c/200.gif">
        <p>It's almost done. Push through the final hour. A victory drink is waiting for you.</p>
